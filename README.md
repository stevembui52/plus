# Simple Shell Project

## Description:bulb:

The objective of this project is to create from scratch a simple UNIX command interpreter with limited functionality but applying the core concepts of a more robust shell. In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.

* How does a shell work.
* What is a PID and a ppid, and how to use them.
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process.
* What is the difference between a function and a system call.
* How to create processes.
* How does the shell use the ```PATH``` to find the programs.
* How to execute another program with the ```execve``` system call.
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates.
